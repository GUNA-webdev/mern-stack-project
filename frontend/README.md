# Restaurant Reservation System (Frontend)

## Description
 - This is the frontend of a simple restaurant reservation system. I built it using React(JSX) to let users easily
   reserve a table by entering their details like name,mobile number, email, number of guests, date, and time.

## Features 
 -  Simple and responsive reservation form.
 -  Input validations to ensure correct data.
 -  Clean design using CSS and Bootstrap.
 -  Small UI enhancements using React Icons.

## Technologies
 -  React (JSX) – to build the website pages.
 -  CSS & Bootstrap – for styling and layout.
 -  React Router DOM – for navigating between pages.
 -  Axios – to connect with backend APIs.
 -  React Hot Toast – for notifications.
 -  React Icons – for better visuals.

## What I Did

- Focused mainly on form handing and input validation.
- Integrated frontend components with backend API to submit and display reservation data.
